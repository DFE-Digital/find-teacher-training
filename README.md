## Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.6.1
- PostgreSQL
- NodeJS 8.11.x
- Yarn 1.12.x

## Setting up the app in development

1. Run `bundle install` to install the gem dependencies
2. Run `yarn` to install node dependencies
3. Run `bin/rails db:setup` to set up the database development and test schemas, and seed with test data
4. Run `bundle exec rails server` to launch the app on http://localhost:3000
5. Run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` in a separate shell for faster compilation of assets

## Running specs, linter(without auto correct) and annotate models and serializers

```
bundle exec rake
```

## Running specs

```
bundle exec rspec
```

## Linting

It's best to lint just your app directories and not those belonging to the framework, e.g.

```bash
bundle exec govuk-lint-ruby app config db lib spec Gemfile --format clang -a

or

bundle exec govuk-lint-sass app/webpacker/styles
```
