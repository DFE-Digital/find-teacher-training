We also have access to teaching space in East Staffordshire. All our classrooms are set up for young children to be taught within it as well as yourselves. The rooms are fully equipped and you will have access to an extensive set of resources to support all curriculum areas within early years, primary and special needs education. Many of these can be loaned to you whilst on placement. \r\n\r\nWhilst our programme trains you to become a General Primary Practitioner, we are delighted also to offer specialisms. Our specialisms include, Early Years (PGCE with QTS), English and the Performing Arts Foreign Languages, Geography and History, Mathematics (specialism NOT specialist), Physical Education, Science and Art and Design.\r\n\r\nWe also offer Pedagogy and SEND (5-11) programme with our subject specialisms (excluding Early Years). Trainees will benefit from experience across 2 placements, a combination of mainstream and special school settings. We are very excited by this highly innovative, successful and much needed programme. More information can be found on our [website](https://knste-shaw.org.uk/programme-information/#pedagogy-and-send-pathway); if you are interested in enriching your specialism with a Special Educational Needs focus then please have a look at our programme offered through the Blackfriars Teaching School Alliance (1JA). \r\nIf you are interested in applying for our part-time route, you will need to select this at the point of application.

You will be supported in carefully considering how through disciplined thinking you can connect English with other areas of the curriculum particularly focusing on performing arts. English is not only an essential National Curriculum subject but it also unlocks learning in all subjects whether that be through reading, writing, speaking or listening. \r\nWe will encourage you to consider how best to harness children's curiosity in relation to a variety of texts and literary stimuli. You will be encouraged to think carefully about progression, assessment and curriculum organisation by benefiting from the expertise of practitioners currently working in our partnership schools.  \r\n\r\n",

You will be able to benefit from placements in two of these settings; each providing a contrasting experience. Whilst on placement we will support you in offering your pupils an appropriately high quality curriculum, one that both engages and excites them.\r\n\r\nIf you are on our Early Years specialism or our SEND pathway then your first placement will be in an EY or SEND environment and your second placement will be in a mainstream primary school. \r\n\r\nPlacement schools are carefully selected for you, and may involve some travel. Across the course we endeavour to minimise travel, though you may have to travel for up to an hour from your home address– note that we do not pay travel expenses.\r\n\r\nDuring the ‘Initial Phase’ you attend the SCITT for two days and your school for three days. The Initial Phase is a gradual introduction into teaching and learning. You will then build up to a teaching commitment of 50% of a class timetable. Individual’s timetable will vary, but in terms of proportions, the following is a guide. Approximately 25% English, 25% maths, 25% science and 25% Foundation subjects (preferably including your specialism, if appropriate).\r\n\r\nYour second placement is undertaken in a different school, following successful completion of your first placement.  During this final placement, you will benefit from being ‘in class’ 75% of the time, 60% will involve you in leading the teaching and 10% - 15% can be team teaching and/ or small group work, including for example the Switch on Reading or SEND interventions. In your very final weeks your percentage teaching time will increase to be equivalent to the expectations of an NQT so that you are truly job ready!  In these final few weeks there may be the opportunity for you to undertake an enrichment placement that enables you to develop a particular develop aspect of your teaching. ",

You will be hosted by both a member of the SCITT team and a senior school-based colleague. If you have applied for our SEND Pathway (see Blackfriars) then you will be interviewed within one of our special school settings.  During the afternoon interview session you will be invited to teach a 15 minute learning sequence to a class that relates to your specialism.\r\n\r\nWe recognise that this is a demanding process. It is one that involves considerable commitment from you. Our experience suggests that this rigorous process enables us to best match applicants to the places available. Ours is an intense, high quality programme and we need to both assure ourselves, and give you the confidence, that you are best placed to make the most of the opportunities that we have on offer.
