We utilise the resources of the school and our alliance partners to achieve this aim. Whether you are attending your one day per week at University or additional professional sessions within your host school, you will be working towards meeting the national Teaching Standards. Within the school setting, as your confidence and knowledge develops, you will be mentored and guided to work towards managing a trainees teaching timetable by the final term of your course.  You will then be prepared to teach a Newly Qualified Teachers timetable the following year.  We will fully support you and tailor the programme as much as possible to accommodate  your needs.  In addition, at Hertfordshire University you will also benefit from access to the University's extensive resources, including those provided by the library and student support services.\r\n\r\nThe School Direct programme provides you with a series of subject enhancement sessions, and a programme of professional studies which will be run at the University and at your host school. These may include sessions which:\r\n•Allow you to visit a variety of partnership schools and non-formal educational sites to enhance learning in specialist areas.\r\n•Provide you with opportunities to enhance your knowledge and pedagogy of your subject, or specialist area of the curriculum.\r\n•Develop your understanding of key contemporary issues within education, such as those around inclusion or EAL and SEND provision in schools.\r\n\r\nYou will critically evaluate the effectiveness of a wide range of resources and your own lesson plans. You will analyse research data and critically evaluate how research has contributed to the knowledge and understanding of how to teach effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to developing the knowledge and skills required to teach, you will also be able to identify and evaluate effective strategies for assessing children's learning through formative and summative assessment strategies. You will learn to critically evaluate the effectiveness of a wide range of resources for your subject and understand the importance of literacy, numeracy and ICT in delivering the curriculum.\r\n",

We have high expectations of all our training teachers and work tirelessly to ensure that each individual reaches their full potential and becomes confident and highly employable. As a result, rates of employment are high across the partnership and many of our trainees stay within the partnership for their first teaching post. Our trainees come form a diverse range of backgrounds and typically all complete their training as good or outstanding trainees. During the last Ofsted inspection, inspectors commended the strong support for current and former trainees and the skilful way in which tutors tailor their work to meet the individual needs of trainees, providing challenge and support as required. Trainees are encouraged to develop their own support networks with peers, sharing resources and ideas. As a result, trainees are confident and able to seek advice and help during and after they have completed training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
