The course requires a study of academic literature and completion of professional assignments, alongside two school based placements. The course is designed to show that trainee teachers demonstrate that they have met the standards for Qualified Teacher Status. \r\nYou will explore a wide ranging content, and be expected to convey the subject with passion and enthusiasm to students. The material taught will be in line with Placement School curriculum, but you can assume to have a spread of modern, medieval and ancient history lessons.\r\nThe development of core history skills is a key focus in both KS3 and KS4, and you will be taught how best to convey complex historical events, as well as embed both sourcework and historiography to lessons. Through support of excellent mentors, in supportive schools, we will ensure you have the best opportunity to develop into an outstanding History Teacher.\r\nYou will receive a practice-led, hands on experience. Trainees are supported by a Subject Based Tutor within school, the Professional Tutor of the school, the Lead Subject Mentor from the NTTP SCITT, the Programme Facilitators. Subject Studies and General Professional Study sessions enhance your knowledge of teaching and learning and help to develop your pedagogy. Constant self-reflection allows trainees to assess their strengths and development potential, which should allow progression and confidence.\r\nYou will spend the majority of your course in the classroom; working with dedicated professionals. This is the best place to learn the art of teaching.   During your placements you will teach pupils in the 11 to 16 age range. \r\n\r\nSubject Studies are delivered as twilight sessions and take place in the first half of the year so that you have the tools to succeed in your school placements. Sessions are delivered by your Lead Subject Mentor and other experienced teachers.\r\nA selection of subject studies sessions are as follows: \r\nWhat is Humanities? – Understanding why students need to study Humanities subjects\r\nChallenging mis/preconceptions in Humanities – how to tackle stereotyping in History\r\nDifferentiation within Humanities – How do you stretch students in a content heavy subject?\r\nAssessment for learning in Humanities – Measuring learning within humanities\r\nUse of sourcework in lesson – How to make sourcework engaging for students\r\nTeaching outside the classroom – making Humanities an outdoor subject\r\nApproaches and Methodologies towards KS5 Humanities – ",

You will work closely with our trained school based tutors receiving weekly one-to-one meetings to monitor your progress throughout your first and second placement.\r\nTo qualify for QTS we will provide trainees with enough time in schools to demonstrate that they have achieved all the Teachers’ Standards.\r\nYou will train with pupils in the 11 to 16 age range, however in many of our partnership schools there will be the opportunity to experience Post 16 Education too.\r\nYou will be allocated to your placement school as a result of an initial induction and skills audit conducted early in the course.  Your placement school will be identified to meet your needs and therefore may not be your nearest school.\r\n\r\n",

They inspire. They engage. They explain. And they have a lasting impact on the pupils they teach.\r\n\r\nWe’ve been educating teachers, practitioners and professionals since 1878. We’re proud of our history. We’re proud of our present. And we’re proud to be one of the largest teacher training establishments in the country. Each year, we welcome over 700 trainee teachers onto our PGCE courses. We have a partnership of over 1,500 regional schools, colleges and educational organisations. We adopt leading research into our teaching through our Education and Social Research Institute (ESRI). \r\n\r\nSHARING SELFIES TO SHARING KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\nSharing selfies is fun, but there is real joy in sharing knowledge. It’s finding new ways to explain complex theories to students and inspiring a love of learning. Discovering innovative global teaching methods. Using research to make a difference in the classroom.\r\n\r\nYou might debate how pupils learn when they live below the poverty line or explore the effect of the growth mind-set. You might research ways to include bilingual students in your lessons or global methods of teaching maths and how this could help your class.\r\n\r\nWhichever subject you’re hoping to teach, we’ll help you to develop the practical skills you need to teach, to inspire and to engage your class.",

Successful trainees are awarded 60 Masters level credits which they can choose to carry forward to the full Master’s course at a later stage. Our School Direct programme provides a wealth of opportunity for trainees to demonstrate evidence of the Teachers’ Standards required for QTS.\r\n\r\nOur School Direct programme is designed to train teachers in the classroom. Our vision to develop expert teachers and leaders of the future starts with all trainees becoming part of the staff team from the beginning of the academic year. Trainee teachers will learn from experienced colleagues and work closely with the staff in the Design and Technology department. You will be given experience of KS3, KS4 and KS5. The vast majority of the year is spent in the host school that you apply to and you will be allocated a contrasting placement which will include six weeks of teaching elsewhere.

Training will be hosted and delivered by experienced ITT specialists, subject experts and classroom practitioners who currently teach in our partner schools. \r\n\r\nIn addition, there will be subject pedagogy days during the year where trainees will focus on teaching science specifically. These will be delivered by the Science Learning Centre at Ashton Community Science College. Biology, Chemistry and Physics trainees study together on these days and this is really useful because you will find that in most schools you will teach combined science at KS3. Learning together really helps you develop your subject knowledge across the three sciences and we can also organise additional courses for you via the Science Learning Centre to meet your individual needs.\r\n\r\nYou will audit your subject knowledge for the topics you will need to teach at KS3 and 4. Lead Subject Mentors will guide you towards great resources for this and you will be encouraged to join a professional subject association. A shared drive enables you to share resources with each other and school mentors. \r\n\r\nLeeds Beckett University provide the PGCE for our SCITT and this is all online. The modules perfectly compliment the training we deliver and you will gain 60 Master's level credits (https://courses.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/PGCE_distancelearning/)\r\n\r\nOur programme documentation has been described by Ofsted: \"Documentation is very well designed and contributes significantly to trainees' success on the course\" \r\n\r\nAssessment of trainees for QTS is based on all of the following:\r\n- Regular observations of practice with development discussion and \r\n action steps\r\n- Progress towards meeting the expectations of the curriculum\r\n- A final assessment against the requirements of the Teachers Standards at the end of the programme.\r\n\r\nWe have been highly praised by Ofsted for our approach to trainee workload, keeping our requirements concise yet effective.",

After a few weeks you will be planning and delivering whole lessons, building up to approximately 7 hours per week by Christmas. \r\n\r\nThe second placement begins after Christmas in a different school which will give you a contrasting experience and broaden your professional development. Again, you will gradually increase your teaching timetable and for the last few weeks will be full time in school, teaching up to 12 hours per week at that point in May and June.\r\n\r\nPlacements are selected for you on the basis of high quality mentoring, strong subject departments, contrasting schools and reasonable commuting distance. We work with approximately 15 schools in Lancashire. \r\n\r\nOn both placements you will teach the 11-16 age range in your subject. \r\nThere may also be opportunities to spend some time in other partner schools and settings as training needs arise.

Trainees will undertake four days of training per week in their placement school and attend the University of Sussex on Fridays to undertake sessions that cover the theory and practice of teaching.  Trainees will attend a 3-week induction in September at the University of Sussex, thereafter the main school placements will commence with the first week being comprised of a detailed induction by your school's professional and subject mentors.  Trainees will carry out detailed lesson observations for the first two to three weeks followed by around 5 hours of teaching per week, with the number of hours increasing throughout the year as your professional skills and confidence increases.\r\nTrainees will also continue to have professional development sessions with their relevant mentors throughout the year.  Sessions will focus on the development of your subject knowledge and the craft of teaching through observing other teachers, team-teaching, joint planning sessions, etc.  We will also organise for our trainees a 4-6 weeks placement in a complementary school during the latter part of the academic year.  This will provide trainees with a comprehensive understanding of teaching in different school environments. \r\nAll trainee teachers must demonstrate that they have met the Teachers’ Standards in order to gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). You will keep a portfolio of evidence to show that you have done so. \r\nPart-time participants will undertake the programme over a 2-year training programme with hours increasing year-on-year.  During the first year, you will teach two days per week with Fridays at Sussex, and submit the main 6,000 word written assessment comprised of a series of lessons that you will design, teach, evaluate and analyse at Master’s Degree level.  In the second year you will teach for three days per week with a 5-week block of teaching at the end of your course.  \r\nSuccessful School Direct trainees will gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) with the option to achieve a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) from the University of Sussex worth 60 Masters level credits.\r\n[Kent Oaks Consortium](http://www.kentoaksconsortium.co.uk/)\r\n[University of Sussex Teacher Training](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/schooldirect)\r\n",

We understand that the Primary 3-11 age range is a crucial time for children’s development and learning. It is at this formative and particularly receptive stage of development that attitudes towards learning are formed, attitudes that will impact on future life course development. \r\nThe PGCE Primary (3-11) is designed to prepare you for teaching across the Primary age range. There are three modules developed to support your knowledge and understanding of theory, policy and practice, including the Early Years, National Curriculum and SEND frameworks. Two level 7 modules are linked to children’s learning and development as well as curriculum, assessment and pedagogy and you will study these consecutively in the first and second term. The final training module, studied across all three school terms, enables you to observe, reflect on and then undertake the role of the teacher in the Primary phase. The course will enable you to meet the requirements for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). For those wishing to work within Catholic schools, or who wish to develop their understanding of Religious education, there is also the opportunity to undertake the Catholic Certificate in Religious Studies (CCRS) – see Additional Information for details.\r\nTo ensure that the course content is as up-to-date and relevant to current teaching theory and practice as possible, this course will be re-validated at least every five years or sooner, if external changes require it.\r\n",

The interviewer will use your personal statement as a starting point, to find out about you and your interests, experiences and skills relevant to becoming a teacher\r\n\r\nWe will be looking for:\r\n● Your passion to become an outstanding teacher\r\n● Good communication skills, including an ability to speak confidently  and communicate effectively with individuals and groups\r\n● A knowledge of the National Curriculum in your subject or age area and current educational developments",

We work with ‘Outstanding’ schools leading innovations in education, as well as schools that may have difficulties in reaching outcome targets at the end of key stages. \r\n\r\nWhen you train with Leeds Trinity, you’ll experience best practice in school improvement, whichever school you train in.\r\n\r\nYou’ll work with expert school mentors while on placement and receive help, advice and support from University-based link tutors. This combination means you’ll get specialist training on teaching the most difficult aspects of subject content, and understanding children and young people at various ages and stages of development.\r\n\r\nAfter you graduate, we offer excellent support for teachers in the early stages of their career, and have a very strong Early Career Teacher (ECT) programme, with CPD, an active online community, and an annual conference.",

They can also share this plan with the School Partnerships team, who are able to inform the host schools for your placements so they can discuss how to best support you during your school-based training.

Trainees are also able to access and benefit from the full range of university services e.g. writing and academic support, wellbeing services, library and IT, careers, etc.\r\n\r\nThe weekly WRA PS programme covers the core areas of the Initial Teacher Training (ITT) Core Content Framework (CCF) to equip trainees with the essential skills and knowledge they need to develop as professional educators.  Feedback from a former trainee : \"Can't rate these sessions highly enough in terms of how they have helped my progression through the year\".\r\n\r\nTrainee progress is monitored closely throughout the course and assessment made by mentors regarding their achievement of QTS status at the end of the course. Trainees will be required to complete 2 Masters level assignments for their PGCE qualification.\r\n\r\nWRA trainees have access to a comprehensive support structure covering every aspect of their training through staff in their placement schools (subject mentor, department/pastoral staff, ITT coordinator), their university (link tutor, coordinator, subject peers) and the White Rose Alliance (lead teacher, senior mentor, administrator and cohort peers). Feedback from a former trainee:\" Support from all aspects of the course has been excellent and has allowed me to really grow in confidence and competence throughout the year\". \r\n\r\nWhilst the intention is for university and White Rose Alliance sessions to be delivered in person, where this is not possible due to Covid-19 restrictions or exceptional circumstances, alternative arrangements will be made to run university \u0026 White Rose Alliance sessions virtually. \r\n",

During school placements trainees will be expected to cover the 11-16 age range plus obtain experience of some 11-18 teaching during their course. In school you will be given the opportunity to participate in all aspects of school life and the wider school context eg. attending school meetings, extra-curricular activities, school training days and other professional development activities, that will support you in developing your knowledge and understanding of the whole school environment.

For the latest information, please visit www.gov.uk/dfe\r\n\r\nYou will be a registered student with NTU and your qualification will be an NTU award. This means that NTU has responsibility for the quality of your training and you will benefit from the combined expertise of the University and lead placement school. \r\n\r\nThis secondary PGCE teaching degree is based around five modules which are core to all trainees.  The curriculum has been organised so that you will gain substantial support for the study of all modules at the start of the course through front-loaded University-based sessions, before your placements begin. The Learning and Teaching in the Subject module will largely be completed in this period, meaning that you will have clarity about academic expectations and your tutors will have an insight into required support. The other modules will be completed at different stages during the year to ensure both reasonable workload and to allow for the progressive impact of the Learning and Teaching in the Subject and Learning and Teaching in the Wider Context modules (underpinned by the Skills of Enquiry module which is assessed across these two modules) on the Secondary Education Independent Study and Secondary Professional Practice modules which run right until the end of the courses.\r\n",

We place trainees sensitively and would not normally expect you to have to travel for more than 30 minutes from home to get to your placement school.  \r\n\r\nYou will teach students within secondary age ranges, pertinent to your subject area. The school placements are with two contrasting schools to maximise your teaching experience. Placement one is at the very beginning of the Autumn term, giving you an invaluable insight in to the start of the school year and the expectations surrounding this important time for children.  \r\n\r\nYour development will be supported by five intensive training blocks, delivered by experts and practicing teachers to ensure that you have excellent, current pedagogy.  You will be given a mentor in each of your placements whom you will meet each week to discuss your progress.  You will also be thoroughly immersed in the pastoral role of a teacher; you will be assigned to support a tutor group to gain an excellent understanding of the critical work a tutor does to monitor academic progress as well as caring for students’ welfare.\r\n\r\nYou will also gain first-hand experience of how your placement school delivers spiritual, moral, social and cultural education, as well as sex and relationships education.

In your formal interview we will discuss your application in further detail and your motivation for teaching.  \r\n\r\nWe are looking for applicants with a clear passion for both teaching and their subject; strong candidates will also show that they are at ease with pupils.  As part of this process you will also teach a short episode (30 to 40 minutes) in your subject area to a class.  We are not looking for the 'finished article' at this stage but you should aim to show your enthusiasm for your subject and positive relationships with students. Once the lesson has finished you will have the opportunity to write a reflection on your lesson. We will also ask you to sit a recent external examination paper in your subject.\r\n\r\nOnce the interview process is complete we meet as a panel to discuss all elements of the process.

Successful completion of the course leads to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS)* and a postgraduate qualification.\r\n  *The title of this award is subject to change due to an ongoing government consultation. For the latest information, please visit www.gov.uk/dfe\r\n\r\nYou will be a registered student with NTU and your qualification will be an NTU award. This means that NTU has responsibility for the quality of your training and you will benefit from the combined expertise of the University and lead placement school. \r\n\r\nThis secondary PGCE teaching degree is based around five modules which are core to all trainees.  The curriculum has been organised so that you will gain substantial support for the study of all modules at the start of the course through front-loaded University-based sessions, before your placements begin. The Learning and Teaching in the Subject module will largely be completed in this period, meaning that you will have clarity about academic expectations and your tutors will have an insight into required support. The other modules will be completed at different stages during the year to ensure both reasonable workload and to allow for the progressive impact of the Learning and Teaching in the Subject and Learning and Teaching in the Wider Context modules (underpinned by the Skills of Enquiry module which is assessed across these two modules) on the Secondary Education Independent Study and Secondary Professional Practice modules which run right until the end of the courses.\r\n",

All aspects of pedagogy will be covered, and you will have opportunities to watch outstanding practitioners demonstrating their skills in the classroom. \r\n\r\nEducational theories are taught and practical application in the classroom is explored. The emphasis is on evaluation and reflection throughout to help you consider the relevance of these concepts, enabling you to discover more about the kind of teacher you want to be. \r\n\r\nTeaching geography allows us to educate children and enrich their lives in order to prepare themselves for future success. This focus on cultural capital is something that separates geography from other subjects by making every topic applicable to real-life and allowing students to acknowledge the world around them. The subject studies sessions include a range of individual and group activities, and often follow on from the professional studies sessions. Although there is scope to become more bespoke by concentrating on areas of concern for individual trainees, for example: focusing on “teaching tricky topics” that are identified as part of the subject knowledge audit, which is completed before the course begins. Your geography specific Subject Leader will work with you directly to develop your teaching style and be another avenue of support during your teacher training year.\r\n\r\nThe course content is wide ranging and you will learn about how to plan lessons specific to your subject to help all the young people in your classrooms make progress; how to enable positive behaviour in classrooms; and how to work with parents. \r\n\r\nFeedback will be both formal and informal and always based around helping you to reflect on your own strengths and next steps. Trainees have regular collaborative progress checks and a scheduled weekly mentor meeting whilst on placement, so you can be sure that you will know how you’re doing at all times. The final recommendation for QTS is based around a combination of reports and your classroom practice.\r\n\r\nAs an accredited provider, we work in partnership with Birmingham City University for the PGCE element of the programme and all of the learning here is aimed at developing your pedagogical understanding. It is a complimentary programme, which enhances your classroom practice.\r\n",

                "how_school_placements_work": "We strongly believe that the best place for a trainee teacher is in schools, developing your skill set through a cycle of observation, reflection, practise and feedback. Therefore the course is split into 25% Professional Studies sessions and 75% in school placements. Trainees are placed in at least two schools, which are carefully selected in order to provide a range of different experiences, giving you the best chances of developing your practice. For example, you might be placed in a rural school for one of your placements and an urban school for another. This increases your chances of employment and ensures you are a well-rounded practitioner.  \r\n\r\nWhilst on placement, you will be in the role of a teacher, and will therefore be able to take opportunities to learn about how the school day works – thus, you should plan to work full school days, including attending meetings before and after school, as well as preparing for parents’ evenings and after school activities, like awards ceremonies. We are also passionate about protecting our teachers and ensuring work/life balance is achieved. There are specific professional studies sessions related to this. Furthermore, although your timetable will increase so that by the end of the year, your teaching commitment is similar to that of a Newly Qualified Teacher, we gradually build up your timetable, at a rate that is right for you. It is our deep belief that mastering the craft of teaching is more important than arbitrarily increasing the number of lessons that you plan and teach.\r\n\r\nTrainees are assigned a personal subject specific mentor whilst on placement, who will work with you to set achievable targets, to help you to become the very best teacher you can be. You will constantly be working towards the Teachers’ Standards and will be supported and guided by Tudor Grange SCITT throughout the program. \r\n\r\nThe programme is an 11-16 offer, with post 16 enhancement. In reality, this means that when you are confidently mastering KS3 and 4 teaching, we will seek to find opportunities for you at post-16. We find that this helps with employability.",

This allows us to understand your baseline and develop strategies for how we can work with you to fill any subject knowledge gaps prior to the course beginning, and to continue to provide bespoke support.\r\nUnseen task - Information on the task is given on the interview day.\r\nPanel interview – Your education philosophy and values, resilience, and knowledge of National Curriculum will all be explored during the panel interview.\r\n20 minute session delivery to a KS3 class – You will be provided with a topic for the session (set by the class teacher) a week in advance to allow you to prepare. During the session we will be looking at how candidates have demonstrated learner progress, their relationships with young people, and their ability to plan.\r\n\r\nWe aim to share outcomes of the interview process on the day, including detailed and meaningful feedback where applicable.
