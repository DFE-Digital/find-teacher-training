          "train_with_us": "We are a large SCITT, working with schools of all kinds (primary, secondary, special, independent) in the London area and across southern England. We have rolling recruitment, meaning that trainees can start in September or later in the academic year. \r\n\r\nOur course suits those who are independent, self-motivated learners. An individual training plan guides each trainee; we have an extensive on-line library, and training days in central London complement the in-school training. Trainees are assessed every five weeks, which ensures that they know what they have done well, and what to focus on next. Each trainee has a visiting tutor who is a secondary subject, or primary, specialist. Tutors visit their trainees for a full day each half term. These visits include two lesson observations of the trainee, feedback on strengths and development points, and a check on progress overall.\r\n\r\nOur aim is that all our trainees become excellent teachers. Everything we do is focused on this. In each of the last three years, two-thirds of our trainees have been graded 'excellent' in the final assessment for QTS. Over 90% have been appointed to a teaching post in the school in which they trained or did a placement (a few take teaching posts in other schools).  \r\n",
          "train_with_disability": "Our course is designed to be flexible and responsive to individual needs. As a group of full-time trainees starts each term, trainees who aren't able to train on a full-time basis, or who become ill and need time off during the course, don't miss out on any training as they join in with the next group of trainees. Adapted tasks are available for students whose dyslexia makes it hard to write full essays for their assignments. Training day venues have wheelchair access, and cater for all dietary requirements. We ask trainees to let us know of any disability or other need, so that we and the partner schools can make appropriate arrangements.\r\n\r\nTrainees who wish to gain a PGCE as well as QTS can add the academic award through our higher education partner. As we do not have a compulsory integral PGCE we have great flexibility in meeting our trainees' individual training needs eg we can adapt  coursework tasks for those who need individual arrangements, we don't have fixed coursework deadlines during the training, and our trainees can start the course when it suits them  and their school during the academic year.\r\n",

The interview panel will consist of a subject-specialist from the host school; a representative from the South East Learning Alliance and often a University representative.  \r\n\r\nWhilst the interview process is both rigorous and robust - we have experienced great success with this practice; ensuring the right candidates progress onto the right courses - leading to excellent rates of retention.",

This means that schools can choose the teacher training provider they wish to work with and have more control over what training is provided and how it is delivered, including how much training will take place within the school partnership. Schools recruit the trainees they want, and trainees will go on to teach in their school, or another school in their partnership, once qualified.  It is part of a wider set of reforms designed to help schools take greater responsibility for leading and shaping ITT, including new approaches to university-school partnerships, Teaching Schools ITT role, and the accreditation of new school-led providers.\r\n\r\nFor 2020/21 two types of School Direct training places are available:\r\n•\tThe School Direct Training Programme, which is open to all graduates and funded by tuition fees paid by the trainee, who may be eligible to receive a bursary.\r\n•\tThe School Direct Training Programme (salaried), which is an employment-based route into teaching for high quality graduates with three or more years' career experience. The trainee is employed as an unqualified teacher by a school. The DfE provides funding, which the school can use to subsidise the trainee's salary and/or training.\r\n\r\nDelta Teaching School Alliance School Direct Trainees will:\r\n•\tBe supported by outstanding teachers, have a school-based mentor and an academic tutor from the university who will be an expert specialist in the field. All of these will be dedicated to your development towards becoming a high quality reflective practitioner.\r\n•\tGain a PGCE which includes qualified teacher status and can be used as the first third of a masters degree if you wish to continue with this accredited professional development in the early part of your career.\r\n•\tBenefit from high quality sessions with other trainees across Delta Teaching School Alliance to develop your knowledge and application of effective strategies that underpin learning and achievement in the classroom.\r\n•\tUtilise outstanding current teachers and school leaders to lead taught sessions, ensuring you learn from those who are current teachers and school leaders.\r\n•\tBenefit from high quality sessions with other PGCE students at the university where research-informed practice and theoretical underpinning of classroom practice will be shared and critiqued.\r\n•\tBe supported through our Specialist Leaders of Education (SLEs) who are designated practitioners with national recognition for their expertise.\r\n",

First placements are confirmed at the Delta TSA School Direct Induction which takes place towards the end of the Summer Term (late June / early July).\r\n\r\nAs Delta Academies Trust has academies based across Yorkshire and the Humber, we will always aim to try and place trainees in academies that are closest to where they live to cut down on commuting time.  For more information as to which academies are part of Delta Teaching School Alliance, please visit our website.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrainees will follow their Academy calendar and the timetable at the University, training in academies four days per week throughout the whole academic year.  Each Friday trainees attend the University to learn as part of a professional cohort of training teachers and spend the rest of the week learning to teach in their Academy. They will also complete a placement in a second academy during the Spring Term that provides an alternative experience, and have the opportunity nearer the end of the course to undertake experience in a range of educational settings such as Sixth form academies, Special Needs Academies etc.  A trained mentor/school based trainer will work with the trainee and support their professional development throughout the year.\r\n\r\nAlthough trainees will be based in an academy, an important element of this School Direct programme will be training days held each week at the University. Training days will be attended by all School Direct trainees on the programme and will provide opportunities for them to reflect on academy experience and to meet with other School Direct trainees in the region.  The course will lead to a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with the opportunity of gaining up to 60 credits at Masters level, as well as meeting the requirements of Teacher Standards (QTS).\r\n",

We will then invite candidates to a one-day assessment centre, hosted at one of our academies in the Delta Academies Trust group.\r\n\r\nThe assessment centre will test various skills and qualities through different assessment methods. The assessment centre will involve candidates observing lessons, teaching the panel 'something' (either an academic or non-academic subject) and answering a set of interviews questions. In addition to the tasks mentioned, Primary Phase candidates will have to complete Sheffield Hallam University English and Maths tests and Secondary Phase candidates an English test. The tests are a compulsory requirement for all candidates wanting to train with Sheffield Hallam University and Delta Teaching School Alliance.\r\n\r\nOnce candidates have completed the one day assessment centre, Delta Academies Trust will confirm via the UCAS system whether candidates have been successful or not.  Once candidates have confirmed their training place, Delta Teaching School Alliance and Sheffield Hallam University will write to candidates with an offer letter, outlining conditions of the offer.\r\n",

          "train_with_us": "We are a large SCITT, working with schools of all kinds (primary, secondary, special, independent) in the London area and across southern England. We have rolling recruitment, meaning that trainees can start in September or later in the academic year. \r\n\r\nOur course suits those who are independent, self-motivated learners. An individual training plan guides each trainee; we have an extensive on-line library, and training days in central London complement the in-school training. Trainees are assessed every five weeks, which ensures that they know what they have done well, and what to focus on next. Each trainee has a visiting tutor who is a secondary subject, or primary, specialist. Tutors visit their trainees for a full day each half term. These visits include two lesson observations of the trainee, feedback on strengths and development points, and a check on progress overall.\r\n\r\nOur aim is that all our trainees become excellent teachers. Everything we do is focused on this. In each of the last three years, two-thirds of our trainees have been graded 'excellent' in the final assessment for QTS. Over 90% have been appointed to a teaching post in the school in which they trained or did a placement (a few take teaching posts in other schools).  \r\n",
          "train_with_disability": "Our course is designed to be flexible and responsive to individual needs. As a group of full-time trainees starts each term, trainees who aren't able to train on a full-time basis, or who become ill and need time off during the course, don't miss out on any training as they join in with the next group of trainees. Adapted tasks are available for students whose dyslexia makes it hard to write full essays for their assignments. Training day venues have wheelchair access, and cater for all dietary requirements. We ask trainees to let us know of any disability or other need, so that we and the partner schools can make appropriate arrangements.\r\n\r\nTrainees who wish to gain a PGCE as well as QTS can add the academic award through our higher education partner. As we do not have a compulsory integral PGCE we have great flexibility in meeting our trainees' individual training needs eg we can adapt  coursework tasks for those who need individual arrangements, we don't have fixed coursework deadlines during the training, and our trainees can start the course when it suits them  and their school during the academic year.\r\n",

We have rolling recruitment, meaning that trainees can start in September or later in the academic year. \r\n\r\nOur course suits those who are independent, self-motivated learners. An individual training plan guides each trainee; we have an extensive on-line library, and training days in central London complement the in-school training. Trainees are assessed every five weeks, which ensures that they know what they have done well, and what to focus on next. Each trainee has a visiting tutor who is a secondary subject, or primary, specialist. Tutors visit their trainees for a full day each half term. These visits include two lesson observations of the trainee, feedback on strengths and development points, and a check on progress overall.\r\n\r\nOur aim is that all our trainees become excellent teachers. Everything we do is focused on this. In each of the last three years, two-thirds of our trainees have been graded 'excellent' in the final assessment for QTS. Over 90% have been appointed to a teaching post in the school in which they trained or did a placement (a few take teaching posts in other schools).  \r\n",
          "train_with_disability": "Our course is designed to be flexible and responsive to individual needs. As a group of full-time trainees starts each term, trainees who aren't able to train on a full-time basis, or who become ill and need time off during the course, don't miss out on any training as they join in with the next group of trainees. Adapted tasks are available for students whose dyslexia makes it hard to write full essays for their assignments. Training day venues have wheelchair access, and cater for all dietary requirements. We ask trainees to let us know of any disability or other need, so that we and the partner schools can make appropriate arrangements.\r\n\r\nTrainees who wish to gain a PGCE as well as QTS can add the academic award through our higher education partner. As we do not have a compulsory integral PGCE we have great flexibility in meeting our trainees' individual training needs eg we can adapt  coursework tasks for those who need individual arrangements, we don't have fixed coursework deadlines during the training, and our trainees can start the course when it suits them  and their school during the academic year.\r\n",

We have rolling recruitment, meaning that trainees can start in September or later in the academic year. \r\n\r\nOur course suits those who are independent, self-motivated learners. An individual training plan guides each trainee; we have an extensive on-line library, and training days in central London complement the in-school training. Trainees are assessed every five weeks, which ensures that they know what they have done well, and what to focus on next. Each trainee has a visiting tutor who is a secondary subject, or primary, specialist. Tutors visit their trainees for a full day each half term. These visits include two lesson observations of the trainee, feedback on strengths and development points, and a check on progress overall.\r\n\r\nOur aim is that all our trainees become excellent teachers. Everything we do is focused on this. In each of the last three years, two-thirds of our trainees have been graded 'excellent' in the final assessment for QTS. Over 90% have been appointed to a teaching post in the school in which they trained or did a placement (a few take teaching posts in other schools).  \r\n",
          "train_with_disability": "Our course is designed to be flexible and responsive to individual needs. As a group of full-time trainees starts each term, trainees who aren't able to train on a full-time basis, or who become ill and need time off during the course, don't miss out on any training as they join in with the next group of trainees. Adapted tasks are available for students whose dyslexia makes it hard to write full essays for their assignments. Training day venues have wheelchair access, and cater for all dietary requirements. We ask trainees to let us know of any disability or other need, so that we and the partner schools can make appropriate arrangements.\r\n\r\nTrainees who wish to gain a PGCE as well as QTS can add the academic award through our higher education partner. As we do not have a compulsory integral PGCE we have great flexibility in meeting our trainees' individual training needs eg we can adapt  coursework tasks for those who need individual arrangements, we don't have fixed coursework deadlines during the training, and our trainees can start the course when it suits them  and their school during the academic year.\r\n",

We have rolling recruitment, meaning that trainees can start in September or later in the academic year. \r\n\r\nOur course suits those who are independent, self-motivated learners. An individual training plan guides each trainee; we have an extensive on-line library, and training days in central London complement the in-school training. Trainees are assessed every five weeks, which ensures that they know what they have done well, and what to focus on next. Each trainee has a visiting tutor who is a secondary subject, or primary, specialist. Tutors visit their trainees for a full day each half term. These visits include two lesson observations of the trainee, feedback on strengths and development points, and a check on progress overall.\r\n\r\nOur aim is that all our trainees become excellent teachers. Everything we do is focused on this. In each of the last three years, two-thirds of our trainees have been graded 'excellent' in the final assessment for QTS. Over 90% have been appointed to a teaching post in the school in which they trained or did a placement (a few take teaching posts in other schools).  \r\n",
          "train_with_disability": "Our course is designed to be flexible and responsive to individual needs. As a group of full-time trainees starts each term, trainees who aren't able to train on a full-time basis, or who become ill and need time off during the course, don't miss out on any training as they join in with the next group of trainees. Adapted tasks are available for students whose dyslexia makes it hard to write full essays for their assignments. Training day venues have wheelchair access, and cater for all dietary requirements. We ask trainees to let us know of any disability or other need, so that we and the partner schools can make appropriate arrangements.\r\n\r\nTrainees who wish to gain a PGCE as well as QTS can add the academic award through our higher education partner. As we do not have a compulsory integral PGCE we have great flexibility in meeting our trainees' individual training needs eg we can adapt  coursework tasks for those who need individual arrangements, we don't have fixed coursework deadlines during the training, and our trainees can start the course when it suits them  and their school during the academic year.\r\n",

This means that schools can choose the teacher training provider they wish to work with and have more control over what training is provided and how it is delivered, including how much training will take place within the school partnership. Schools recruit the trainees they want, and trainees will go on to teach in their school, or another school in their partnership, once qualified.  It is part of a wider set of reforms designed to help schools take greater responsibility for leading and shaping ITT, including new approaches to university-school partnerships, Teaching Schools ITT role, and the accreditation of new school-led providers.\r\n\r\nFor 2020/21 two types of School Direct training places are available:\r\n•\tThe School Direct Training Programme, which is open to all graduates and funded by tuition fees paid by the trainee, who may be eligible to receive a bursary.\r\n•\tThe School Direct Training Programme (salaried), which is an employment-based route into teaching for high quality graduates with three or more years' career experience. The trainee is employed as an unqualified teacher by a school. The DfE provides funding, which the school can use to subsidise the trainee's salary and/or training.\r\n\r\nDelta Teaching School Alliance School Direct Trainees will:\r\n•\tBe supported by outstanding teachers, have a school-based mentor and an academic tutor from the university who will be an expert specialist in the field. All of these will be dedicated to your development towards becoming a high quality reflective practitioner.\r\n•\tGain a PGCE which includes qualified teacher status and can be used as the first third of a masters degree if you wish to continue with this accredited professional development in the early part of your career.\r\n•\tBenefit from high quality sessions with other trainees across Delta Teaching School Alliance to develop your knowledge and application of effective strategies that underpin learning and achievement in the classroom.\r\n•\tUtilise outstanding current teachers and school leaders to lead taught sessions, ensuring you learn from those who are current teachers and school leaders.\r\n•\tBenefit from high quality sessions with other PGCE students at the university where research-informed practice and theoretical underpinning of classroom practice will be shared and critiqued.\r\n•\tBe supported through our Specialist Leaders of Education (SLEs) who are designated practitioners with national recognition for their expertise.\r\n",

For more information as to which academies are part of Delta Teaching School Alliance, please visit our website.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrainees will follow their Academy calendar and the timetable at the University, training in academies four days per week throughout the whole academic year.  Each Friday trainees attend the University to learn as part of a professional cohort of training teachers and spend the rest of the week learning to teach in their Academy. They will also complete a placement in a second academy during the Spring Term that provides an alternative experience, and have the opportunity nearer the end of the course to undertake experience in a range of educational settings such as Sixth form academies, Special Needs Academies etc.  A trained mentor/school based trainer will work with the trainee and support their professional development throughout the year.\r\n\r\nAlthough trainees will be based in an academy, an important element of this School Direct programme will be training days held each week at the University. Training days will be attended by all School Direct trainees on the programme and will provide opportunities for them to reflect on academy experience and to meet with other School Direct trainees in the region.  The course will lead to a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with the opportunity of gaining up to 60 credits at Masters level, as well as meeting the requirements of Teacher Standards (QTS).\r\n",
        "interview_process": "After applicants have submitted their application via the UCAS system, we will receive the applications and shortlist applications that meet our entry requirements.  We will then invite candidates to a one-day assessment centre, hosted at one of our academies in the Delta Academies Trust group.\r\n\r\nThe assessment centre will test various skills and qualities through different assessment methods. The assessment centre will involve candidates observing lessons, teaching the panel 'something' (either an academic or non-academic subject) and answering a set of interviews questions. In addition to the tasks mentioned, Primary Phase candidates will have to complete Sheffield Hallam University English and Maths tests and Secondary Phase candidates an English test. The tests are a compulsory requirement for all candidates wanting to train with Sheffield Hallam University and Delta Teaching School Alliance.\r\n\r\nOnce candidates have completed the one day assessment centre, Delta Academies Trust will confirm via the UCAS system whether candidates have been successful or not.  Once candidates have confirmed their training place, Delta Teaching School Alliance and Sheffield Hallam University will write to candidates with an offer letter, outlining conditions of the offer.\r\n",

We have rolling recruitment, meaning that trainees can start in September or later in the academic year. \r\n\r\nOur course suits those who are independent, self-motivated learners. An individual training plan guides each trainee; we have an extensive on-line library, and training days in central London complement the in-school training. Trainees are assessed every five weeks, which ensures that they know what they have done well, and what to focus on next. Each trainee has a visiting tutor who is a secondary subject, or primary, specialist. Tutors visit their trainees for a full day each half term. These visits include two lesson observations of the trainee, feedback on strengths and development points, and a check on progress overall.\r\n\r\nOur aim is that all our trainees become excellent teachers. Everything we do is focused on this. In each of the last three years, two-thirds of our trainees have been graded 'excellent' in the final assessment for QTS. Over 90% have been appointed to a teaching post in the school in which they trained or did a placement (a few take teaching posts in other schools).  \r\n",
          "train_with_disability": "Our course is designed to be flexible and responsive to individual needs. As a group of full-time trainees starts each term, trainees who aren't able to train on a full-time basis, or who become ill and need time off during the course, don't miss out on any training as they join in with the next group of trainees. Adapted tasks are available for students whose dyslexia makes it hard to write full essays for their assignments. Training day venues have wheelchair access, and cater for all dietary requirements. We ask trainees to let us know of any disability or other need, so that we and the partner schools can make appropriate arrangements.\r\n\r\nTrainees who wish to gain a PGCE as well as QTS can add the academic award through our higher education partner. As we do not have a compulsory integral PGCE we have great flexibility in meeting our trainees' individual training needs eg we can adapt  coursework tasks for those who need individual arrangements, we don't have fixed coursework deadlines during the training, and our trainees can start the course when it suits them  and their school during the academic year.\r\n",

We have rolling recruitment, meaning that trainees can start in September or later in the academic year. \r\n\r\nOur course suits those who are independent, self-motivated learners. An individual training plan guides each trainee; we have an extensive on-line library, and training days in central London complement the in-school training. Trainees are assessed every five weeks, which ensures that they know what they have done well, and what to focus on next. Each trainee has a visiting tutor who is a secondary subject, or primary, specialist. Tutors visit their trainees for a full day each half term. These visits include two lesson observations of the trainee, feedback on strengths and development points, and a check on progress overall.\r\n\r\nOur aim is that all our trainees become excellent teachers. Everything we do is focused on this. In each of the last three years, two-thirds of our trainees have been graded 'excellent' in the final assessment for QTS. Over 90% have been appointed to a teaching post in the school in which they trained or did a placement (a few take teaching posts in other schools).  \r\n",

As a group of full-time trainees starts each term, trainees who aren't able to train on a full-time basis, or who become ill and need time off during the course, don't miss out on any training as they join in with the next group of trainees. Adapted tasks are available for students whose dyslexia makes it hard to write full essays for their assignments. Training day venues have wheelchair access, and cater for all dietary requirements. We ask trainees to let us know of any disability or other need, so that we and the partner schools can make appropriate arrangements.\r\n\r\nTrainees who wish to gain a PGCE as well as QTS can add the academic award through our higher education partner. As we do not have a compulsory integral PGCE we have great flexibility in meeting our trainees' individual training needs eg we can adapt  coursework tasks for those who need individual arrangements, we don't have fixed coursework deadlines during the training, and our trainees can start the course when it suits them  and their school during the academic year.\r\n",

We have rolling recruitment, meaning that trainees can start in September or later in the academic year. \r\n\r\nOur course suits those who are independent, self-motivated learners. An individual training plan guides each trainee; we have an extensive on-line library, and training days in central London complement the in-school training. Trainees are assessed every five weeks, which ensures that they know what they have done well, and what to focus on next. Each trainee has a visiting tutor who is a secondary subject, or primary, specialist. Tutors visit their trainees for a full day each half term. These visits include two lesson observations of the trainee, feedback on strengths and development points, and a check on progress overall.\r\n\r\nOur aim is that all our trainees become excellent teachers. Everything we do is focused on this. In each of the last three years, two-thirds of our trainees have been graded 'excellent' in the final assessment for QTS. Over 90% have been appointed to a teaching post in the school in which they trained or did a placement (a few take teaching posts in other schools).  \r\n",
          "train_with_disability": "Our course is designed to be flexible and responsive to individual needs. As a group of full-time trainees starts each term, trainees who aren't able to train on a full-time basis, or who become ill and need time off during the course, don't miss out on any training as they join in with the next group of trainees. Adapted tasks are available for students whose dyslexia makes it hard to write full essays for their assignments. Training day venues have wheelchair access, and cater for all dietary requirements. We ask trainees to let us know of any disability or other need, so that we and the partner schools can make appropriate arrangements.\r\n\r\nTrainees who wish to gain a PGCE as well as QTS can add the academic award through our higher education partner. As we do not have a compulsory integral PGCE we have great flexibility in meeting our trainees' individual training needs eg we can adapt  coursework tasks for those who need individual arrangements, we don't have fixed coursework deadlines during the training, and our trainees can start the course when it suits them  and their school during the academic year.\r\n",
