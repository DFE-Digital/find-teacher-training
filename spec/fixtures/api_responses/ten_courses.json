Schools are involved at every stage of the selection, training and assessment of our beginner teachers. This long standing relationship results in excellent support from experienced teachers mentoring trainees on placement and dedicated University tutors offering models of successful pedagogy. As a small friendly department we offer our trainees a personal approach and  aftercare support and training as Newly Qualified Teachers\r\n\r\n\r\nWe train 'thinking' teachers with a over riding desire to make a difference to the lives of young people.   \r\nA research intensive university, we believe teachers benefit from critical engagement in evidence-based practice, reflection on research and continuing professional development as well as excellent practical classroom skills. \r\n\r\nOur University sits on a leafy campus at the edge of the South Downs National Park, accessible by road or rail from East and West Sussex, Brighton and Hove, Surrey, Kent, Hampshire and South London. The historic \r\nseaside city of Brighton is minutes away, with its pebble beaches and vibrant social and cultural opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\nCourse outcomes are consistently high;  100% achieving QTS on first attempt, \r\n94% completing with Merit or Distinction,  \r\n98% securing a teaching post and \r\n99% of ex-trainees rating the course 'good' or 'very good'.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Induction – Placement one – APK – Placement 2 – RPK – Enrichment week \r\n \r\nInduction In this time, you will meet all the people who you will be working with for the rest of the course.  You will attend professional studies sessions as well as curriculum specific sessions. In Science we try to make sure that you head off on your professional practice with some sound basic knowledge of health and safety in the lab, some brief guidance on lesson planning as well as some broad ideas of how you can start to plan good lessons for the pupils. \r\n\r\n\r\nCurriculum Studies Sessions These sessions happen throughout your first professional practice, and occasionally in your second placement.  They are always on Fridays. \r\n \r\nThe structure varies from Friday to Friday, but you will normally be involved in some practical lab-based work, have a group tutorial, as well as have the opportunity to discuss and learn about some pedagogic aspect of teaching.  Some of the Friday sessions take place off campus.\r\n\r\nYou continue to come to University on Fridays for curriculum studies.  There will also be times in professional practice one when you are asked to come to campus for a review meeting. (see your calendar or the main handbook for these times).  You will be working on your APK in placement one and submit it at the start of placement two.  \r\n\r\nProfessional Practice Two In this professional practice, you will spend more of the week in school.  There are only a few Friday sessions at University to allow you to teach more hours in school.  As with professional practice one there should be a short period of induction when you arrive at professional practice two where you are given the opportunity to see how the school policies work in action. \r\n \r\nYou will be working towards a timetable of 12 hours per week in this professional practice.   \r\n \r\nEnd of the Course Once you have successfully completed your second professional practice, the final hurdle is to have a RPK interview.  This interview involves a professional discussion with your tutor and a mentor about your progress over the last year.  You will present your evidence folders as well as the subject knowledge scrapbook. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/pgceandschooldirectsecondary/science \r\n",

Schools are involved at every stage of the selection, training and assessment of our beginner teachers. This long standing relationship results in excellent support from experienced teachers mentoring trainees on placement and dedicated University tutors offering models of successful pedagogy. As a small friendly department we offer our trainees a personal approach and  aftercare support and training as Newly Qualified Teachers\r\n\r\n\r\nWe train 'thinking' teachers with a over riding desire to make a difference to the lives of young people.   \r\nA research intensive university, we believe teachers benefit from critical engagement in evidence-based practice, reflection on research and continuing professional development as well as excellent practical classroom skills. \r\n\r\nOur University sits on a leafy campus at the edge of the South Downs National Park, accessible by road or rail from East and West Sussex, Brighton and Hove, Surrey, Kent, Hampshire and South London. The historic \r\nseaside city of Brighton is minutes away, with its pebble beaches and vibrant social and cultural opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\nCourse outcomes are consistently high;  100% achieving QTS on first attempt, \r\n94% completing with Merit or Distinction,  \r\n98% securing a teaching post and \r\n99% of ex-trainees rating the course 'good' or 'very good'.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Following this, if you have a disability or health condition, you will register with the University Student Support service and an assessment is arranged to establish your needs. The team will identify the additional support and adjustments  recommended to help you be as successful as possible on the course.\r\n",

        "about_course": "The year is divided into four main sections.  We start with induction, and end with the enrichment week.  In between those are the two school professional practices and the assignments.  Induction – Placement one – APK – Placement 2 – RPK – Enrichment week \r\n \r\nInduction In this time, you will meet all the people who you will be working with for the rest of the course.  You will attend professional studies sessions as well as curriculum specific sessions. In Science we try to make sure that you head off on your professional practice with some sound basic knowledge of health and safety in the lab, some brief guidance on lesson planning as well as some broad ideas of how you can start to plan good lessons for the pupils. \r\n\r\nCurriculum Studies Sessions These sessions happen throughout your first professional practice, and occasionally in your second placement.  They are always on Fridays. \r\n \r\nThe structure varies from Friday to Friday, but you will normally be involved in some practical lab-based work, have a group tutorial, as well as have the opportunity to discuss and learn about some pedagogic aspect of teaching.  Some of the Friday sessions take place off campus.\r\n\r\nYou continue to come to University on Fridays for curriculum studies.  There will also be times in professional practice one when you are asked to come to campus for a review meeting. (see your calendar or the main handbook for these times).  You will be working on your APK in placement one and submit it at the start of placement two.  \r\n\r\nProfessional Practice Two In this professional practice, you will spend more of the week in school.  There are only a few Friday sessions at University to allow you to teach more hours in school.  As with professional practice one there should be a short period of induction when you arrive at professional practice two where you are given the opportunity to see how the school policies work in action. \r\n \r\nYou will be working towards a timetable of 12 hours per week in this professional practice.   \r\n \r\nEnd of the Course Once you have successfully completed your second professional practice, the final hurdle is to have a RPK interview.  This interview involves a professional discussion with your tutor and a mentor about your progress over the last year.  You will present your evidence folders as well as the subject knowledge scrapbook. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/pgceandschooldirectsecondary/science \r\n",

In between those are the two school professional practices and the assignments.  Induction – Placement one – APK – Placement 2 – RPK – Enrichment week \r\n \r\nInduction \r\n\r\nThe structure is mainly the same each Friday. In the morning you will be involved as a Cosmo group in exploring some practical aspects of teaching as well as have the opportunity to discuss and learn about some pedagogic aspect of teaching.  In the afternoon you will meet with your subject tutor who will follow your subject specific programme for the year \r\n \r\nProfessional Practice One \r\n \r\nIn your first Professional practice, you will be inducted into school in the first few weeks.  You should have the opportunity to observe pupils and teachers as a way of seeing how the school policies work in action.  It is intended that you will have a gradual introduction to teaching a lesson and should be able to plan small sections of lessons (such as starters and plenaries) before being given a whole lesson to teach.  Normally we would not expect a trainee teacher to teach more than one whole lesson before the October half term, although this may be modified for the skills of the individual teacher.  Note that everyone will have different inductions in their schools.  Try not to compare or fret; if you are unsettled talk to your tutor.  \r\n \r\nWe would hope that you would be working towards a timetable of 8 hours by Christmas.  Remember that we will all progress at various rates and there is no ‘normal’ progression for a trainee teacher.  You will maintain these 8 hours after Christmas to the end of the placement. \r\n\r\n\r\nProfessional Practice Two In this professional practice, you will spend more of the week in school.  There are only a few Friday sessions at University to allow you to teach more hours in school.  As with professional practice one there should be a short period of induction when you arrive at professional practice two where you are given the opportunity to see how the school policies work in action. \r\n \r\nYou will be working towards a timetable of 12 hours per week in this professional practice.  Possibly a few more hours towards the end of the placement.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/education/ite/pgceandschooldirectsecondary/history \r\n\r\n ",

You will consider the learning and teaching strategies that are relevant to the specialist subject. \r\n\r\nThe subject education module is specifically related to teaching the specialist subject in school while the subject study module enables you to take your subject specialist studies to an increased depth. You can earn 20 masters-level credits through the assessment for the subject study module.\r\n\r\nThe education studies strand will give you a thorough understanding of the learning process itself, including an appreciation of individual differences. The study of the principles and practices of learning and teaching is through both school and university settings, allowing you to develop practical competencies, supported by analytical skills. By the end of the course you will:\r\n\r\n-refine your understanding of pedagogy, including an appreciation of current and emerging educational theories and debate\r\n-understand how to use and adapt a range of teaching, learning, management and assessment strategies in order to meet the varying needs of learners\r\n-understand how the progress and well-being of learners is affected by a range of influences and know how to take account of the principles of equality, inclusion and diversity.\r\n\r\nProfessional development is intrinsically linked to all key strands of the programme and is designed to enable you to evaluate critically and reflect upon your learning in order to make improvements. You will be expected to gather and justify evidence of your achievements on a regular basis and develop and implement improvement plans.\r\n\r\nStudents use an e-portfolio to record their achievements, and this is reviewed throughout the course.
