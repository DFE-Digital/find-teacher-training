It plays a vital, often unseen role, in many aspects of life such as transport, mobile phones and space travel. As a society it is important that young people are trained to be analytical, logical and able to solve problems. These are the skills we develop as teachers of Mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are interested in recruiting teachers who find the subject exciting and challenging and are able to share this enthusiasm with young people. To be successful, trainees need to learn how to deliver in a style that suits their own personality but watch and learn from other teachers. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearning in a classroom requires professionalism, organisation, planning, preparation and excellent subject knowledge, across the department. Trainees will experience lessons across a range of ages and attainment, reflecting the diverse needs of students in our schools. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou will work alongside an experienced team of Mathematicians, who have proven ability to ensure achievement for all students. Through the process of observation and team teaching opportunities you will develop the ability to communicate key mathematical concepts and skills.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTrainees are also supported by a school subject based mentor and a link tutor from Leeds SCITT. Constant reflection allows trainees to assess their strengths and development potential, which should allow progression and confidence. You will not be the finished article but we hope this will be the beginning of a challenging and rewarding career, with sound foundations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you share this vision for young people, we want to meet you.",

This allows you to take the theory, thinking and research and see / implement this in the classroom, ensuring you develop your ‘teacher’ persona as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next stage of the course is called Stage 1.  This is a full-time placement in a partnership school with some core development days at your Lead School and Leeds Trinity University.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this stage you will have a dedicated subject mentor who will observe you teach, support you with your planning and developing your subject knowledge for teaching. They will be your first port of call during this stage of training when you establish yourself in the classroom as the teacher.\r\n\r\nThe third stage of the course (Stage 2/3) is a full-time placement in a contrasting partnership school, again with some core development. \r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, in the last two weeks of the training year, you will have the opportunity to undertake an enrichment and enhancement placement or experiences.

Dance addresses choreographic and appreciation skills along with developing pupils' performance competencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrainees with engaging personalities, creativity and a depth of general subject knowledge will build on their existing skills to start their career as teachers of this unique and powerful subject. Leeds SCITT is committed to ensuring the very best for the future of Dance education by training dynamic and exciting new teachers now. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith a smaller cohort than many other Dance ITT courses, Leeds SCITT offers a very personal training experience where trainees are nurtured and given the best tools to become successful teachers.",

Eligible UK and EU students can apply for a tuition fee loan to cover the cost of tuition fees from the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nUK students on non-salaried places studying full-time can apply for a package of maintenance funding from the government to help with general living costs and additional funding if you have children and/or a disability.   \r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish and EU students can apply and find out more information at www.gov.uk/studentfinance.

This school has a specialism in your subject area and the Lead Tutors are subject experts who are also outstanding teachers and trainers.\r\n\r\nEach school has dedicated training areas so that your training consists of quality time with your tutors.\r\n\r\nThe initial training is focused on subject pedagogy;\r\n\r\n•\tHow highly effective planning leads to successful outcomes in the classroom;\r\n\r\n•\tHow you can ensure pupils make good progress in their learning;\r\n\r\n•\tHow you can assess learning to inform next steps and strategies to support highly skilled differentiation.\r\n\r\nYou will be immersed in the school environment from Week 1 and you will be seen as a professional by school staff, pupils and parents. This allows you to take the theory, thinking and research and see / implement this in the classroom, ensuring you develop your ‘teacher’ persona as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next stage of the course is called Stage 1.  This is a full-time placement in a partnership school with some core development days at your Lead School and Leeds Trinity University.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this stage you will have a dedicated subject mentor who will observe you teach, support you with your planning and developing your subject knowledge for teaching. They will be your first port of call during this stage of training when you establish yourself in the classroom as the teacher.\r\n\r\nThe third stage of the course (Stage 2/3) is a full-time placement in a contrasting partnership school, again with some core development. \r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, in the last two weeks of the training year, you will have the opportunity to undertake an enrichment and enhancement placement or experiences. What this looks like is entirely different for each trainee as this is a time to pursue an interest- such as working in a SEND school, an additional subject, organising out of school learning and many more options!\r\n",

Leeds SCITT is committed to ensuring the very best for the future of drama education by training dynamic and exciting new teachers now. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith a smaller cohort than many other Drama ITT courses, Leeds SCITT offers a very personal training experience where trainees are nurtured and given the best tools to become successful teachers.",

Eligible UK and EU students can apply for a tuition fee loan to cover the cost of tuition fees from the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nUK students on non-salaried places studying full-time can apply for a package of maintenance funding from the government to help with general living costs and additional funding if you have children and/or a disability.   \r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish and EU students can apply and find out more information at www.gov.uk/studentfinance.

This school has a specialism in your subject area and the Lead Tutors are subject experts who are also outstanding teachers and trainers.\r\n\r\nEach school has dedicated training areas so that your training consists of quality time with your tutors.\r\n\r\nThe initial training is focused on subject pedagogy;\r\n\r\n•\tHow highly effective planning leads to successful outcomes in the classroom;\r\n\r\n•\tHow you can ensure pupils make good progress in their learning;\r\n\r\n•\tHow you can assess learning to inform next steps and strategies to support highly skilled differentiation.\r\n\r\nYou will be immersed in the school environment from Week 1 and you will be seen as a professional by school staff, pupils and parents. This allows you to take the theory, thinking and research and see / implement this in the classroom, ensuring you develop your ‘teacher’ persona as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next stage of the course is called Stage 1.  This is a full-time placement in a partnership school with some core development days at your Lead School and Leeds Trinity University.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this stage you will have a dedicated subject mentor who will observe you teach, support you with your planning and developing your subject knowledge for teaching. They will be your first port of call during this stage of training when you establish yourself in the classroom as the teacher.\r\n\r\nThe third stage of the course (Stage 2/3) is a full-time placement in a contrasting partnership school, again with some core development. \r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, in the last two weeks of the training year, you will have the opportunity to undertake an enrichment and enhancement placement or experiences. What this looks like is entirely different for each trainee as this is a time to pursue an interest- such as working in a SEND school, an additional subject, organising out of school learning and many more options!\r\n",

This means we will work with you to make reasonable adjustments. \r\nCommon reasonable adjustments include:\r\n\r\nmaking modifications to buildings where possible\r\noffering flexible working hours\r\nproviding specialist equipment\r\n",

PGCE students are  registered to study for a Postgraduate Certificate in Education qualification (PGCert) (FHEQ Level 7) and awards are from Leeds Trinity University.\r\n\r\nAll PGCE courses with Leeds SCITT are offered in the 11-16 age range with the opportunity to experience teaching at post-16 level.\r\n\r\nAs a Leeds SCITT trainee teacher, you will be immersed in the school environment from week one and you will be seen as a professional by school staff, pupils and parents. This allows you to take the theory, thinking and research and see / implement this in the classroom, ensuring you develop your ‘teacher’ persona as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nOur courses are divided into three main stages. The Lead School Experience is spent predominantly in your lead school with the other trainees in your subject and this is where you will begin your teaching of classes in pairs or individually. \r\n\r\nStage 1 is when you start your first full time teaching placement in a partnership school, teaching a reduced timetable with support and guidance from your subject mentor.\r\n\r\nFinally, Stage 2/3 allows you to consolidate your learning in a full time teaching placement in a different partnership school as you prepare for your first teaching job.",
