The training team have all been fantastic mentors and encouraged me throughout my years training, keeping me on track and providing me with endless support. The training team continuously look for ways to improve the course and listen to the suggestions we make, leading to us having training sessions that were both relevant and engaging from trainers we enjoyed. Overall I have really enjoyed my training year and feel well prepared to undertake my new adventure in September! Thank you :)\" NQT July 2020\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I could have found a more positive, supportive provider for my training. The training team themselves have gone out of their way to support us this year. The teaching staff have been wonderful mentors and I have learnt so much from them. I wish I could do it all over again.\" NQT July 2020 \r\n",
