Trainees are able to benefit from this extra time by absorbing more of the excellent teaching practices around them, as well as being accepted as a member of teaching staff quickly. \r\n\r\nThe Primary (5-11) course aims to give participants experience of the full range of ages between 5 and 11 in two contrasting school placements. Trainees initially observe and wok with small groups, eventually leading to whole class teaching in two different schools. Trainees also benefit from taking part in three focus weeks based on SEND, Outdoor Education and Christian Distinctiveness. In addition, taught sessions will take place once or twice a week at Plymouth Marjon University where trainees will essentially be taught the academic requirements of the PGCE course. \r\nSchool Direct trainees on our programme will complete placements in two contrasting schools, teaching in different age phases at each one and within different sized and located schools. Placement schools will be chosen in discussion with trainees linked to preferences of location, size of school and any transport needs. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

During all three placements trainees will work closely with their class teachers and other teachers within the schools. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, trainees will also complete shorter placements within focus weeks, covering SEND, Outdoor Education and Church School Distinctiveness.
