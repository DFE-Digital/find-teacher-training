One of these practices will take place in a partnership school and in a different Key Stage. Our partnership includes around 40 schools across North London and regularly expands. \r\n\r\nExperience in school progresses from observing and working alongside the class teacher, to taking full responsibility, initially for individuals and groups, and later, for a whole class.\r\n\r\nThroughout this experience trainees acquire the skills, knowledge and understanding of the range of elements which make an outstanding teacher, as specified in the Teachers’ Standards; from developing good relationships with children that promote learning, with other colleagues to working within a framework and national and school policies to deliver the Curriculum.",
